Looking for a UK Money Transfer credit card that beats the Tesco Bank All-Round credit card @3.99% to use OPM (other peoples money) filling ISA's

The thought was borrow low, get a better return and pocket the difference.

As of 20/06/2025, comparing personal loans, p2p lending etc, this is the cheapest I could find.

We have ages until the UK ISA allowance resets so this will likely get added to in regards to sources but all works (need beautifulsoup & playwright)
*For this Tesco card you can transfer 95% of the balance.
